This lab overall went pretty smoothly, everyone know what to do. Zain did the algorithm while i did the coding. The coding went a little rough when me and zain had diffeerent idea for the error checking and then i had to change some things around. When i was coding there was also a problem when i was trying to iput the values into the list of sums until i found out that the list was in a different index order from my value that i got. Overall everything in my lab went well.
