The Goal: Our goal was to make a application that would output a graphic which showed the sum of all the possible outcomes. 


The point of this: We did this lab to strenthen our knowledge with list. 
The notes from class defintly helped aswell as youtube videos online because I was confused on how to add something to a list throughout the application.

Difficulties: The hardest part was my partner being sick. I had to work on the algorithm by myself without any help. None the less, Ethan gave me his number and he commincated effictivly with me so we were able to complete it.

I was able to get around half of the algorithm done in class because I had difficulties setting up my pycharm but Mr.Zee helped me get the community edition. 
The hardest part of making the algoritm was actually understanding what this lab wanted from us. It took me like 20 mintues untill I realized what it was actually asking from me, which was to simulate the sums that would happen.
I was also able to use my improved knowledege of functions from the previous lab to help make the algorithm. 

I did the algorithms and harry used to do the code. He did a great job on doing the code but forgot error checking so i added it. None the less, harrys code worked great.

Reflection: Honestly, this was one of the most rewarding labs we did. unlike the other ones, it was actually fun to use and play around with. The other ones, were like simulations of atms which kind of got boring. But for this one I got to see the outcomes of the sums and stuff and it would change everytime which was super fun to play around with. Overall, this was a super rewarding lab and I enjoyed this lab alot.
